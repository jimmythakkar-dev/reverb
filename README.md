# README

Please follow the instructions for setting up and running the application on ubuntu environment:

* Please install Ruby 2.3+

* Please install Rails 5.0.7

* Run : bundle install 

* Start up the application with : rails server

* I have implemented all the features mentioned in the problem statement. However for the ease of my own development for now, while searching for categories please type at least 4 characters in the textbox and after selecting the needed category please press enter to search on products listing based on category.

* I haven't written all the test cases, because I have only worked on the coding challenge for around 3 hours. I can write other test cases if that is required.
  For running the test cases run : bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/search_products_controller_spec.rb  

* I haven't tried to make the app look aesthetically pleasing, just some basic styling with bootstrap is added.
